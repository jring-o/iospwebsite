## PART V: THE ALTERNATIVE TIMELINE (Scene 14)

### Institutional Science System (1950)
**Tagline:** Protocols Become Global Infrastructure

**Overview:** Federal funding transforms science at scale. The creation of NSF (1950) and expansion of NIH establish stable, large-scale public funding—replacing the fragmented systems of previous eras. The five protocols, which first emerged together in Organized Science and professionalized over the following century, now become integrated into a self-reinforcing global system: federal grants fund research → peer review validates claims → journals disseminate findings → citations allocate credit → tenure rewards productivity. This configuration achieves immense success and global dominance—but it was never intentionally designed. It emerged organically. Now it faces mounting stress from challenges it wasn't built to handle.

**Configuration:**
- **Dominant:** Quality + Coordination (depends on citations, moves slowly)
- **Values:** Academic credit, prestige, reputation
- **Timeline:** Very slow (3-5 year projects, 6-7 year tenure)
- **Access:** Restricted (paywalls, subscription journals)
- **Metrics:** Citations, h-index, journal Impact Factor, tenure, grants

**Technical Substrate:** PDF and web publishing; email and HTTP/HTTPS; DOIs and ORCIDs for persistent identification; XML metadata schemas (Dublin Core, JATS); citation databases (Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar); preprint servers (arXiv, bioRxiv); institutional authentication (Shibboleth); publisher platforms; data repositories (Zenodo, Figshare); version control (Git); federal grant systems (NSF, NIH); bibliometric indices (Impact Factor, h-index); formalized peer review infrastructure; cloud computing

**Problem:** Bearing too much weight; stressed by reproducibility crisis, funding scarcity, fraud, monopoly pricing

**Protocol Effects:**
- **Inference:** Federal grants fund hypothesis-driven research at universities
- **Quality:** Peer review by academic experts determines validity
- **Engagement:** Academic journals disseminate findings to researcher communities
- **Coordination:** Grant cycles and tenure systems coordinate researcher incentives
- **Preservation:** University libraries and journal archives preserve the record

---

### Networked Technical Substrate Era (1969-1999)
**Substrate:** Packet switching, TCP/IP protocols, distributed network architecture (ARPANET 1969), email (SMTP), FTP, Telnet, DNS, UNIX operating system, C programming language, open source movement (GNU 1983, Linux 1991), World Wide Web (1991), HTTP/HTTPS, distributed version control concepts

**Overview:** Networked computing infrastructure emerges, enabling decentralized communication and collaboration. A technical substrate for digital systems begins to form. The system operates independently on mostly isolated infrastructure.

---

### Corporate Science System (1980)
**Tagline:** A Second Configuration Emerges

**Overview:** A second complete system emerges with a radically different configuration of the five protocols—VC and corporate funding instead of grants, patents in addition to journals, FDA approval instead of peer review alone, trade secrets instead of open publication. Catalyzed by Genentech IPO (1980) creating organizational model for biotech startups. Optimized for rapid translation to products and profit.

**Configuration:**
- **Dominant:** Inference + Coordination (speed, profit, secrecy)
- **Values:** Commercial translation, financial returns, market dominance
- **Timeline:** Fast (<1 year cycles, quarterly milestones)
- **Access:** Highly restricted (trade secrets, delayed publication)
- **Metrics:** FDA approvals, patents, valuations, IPO/acquisition, revenue

**Technical Substrate:** Proprietary databases and internal knowledge management; trade secret document systems; FDA regulatory platforms (eCTD, CDER); patent databases and IP management; closed clinical trial registries; proprietary analytics and drug discovery platforms; siloed data lakes with restricted access; walled authentication systems incompatible with open infrastructure

**Key Difference:** Less focus on citations; optimizes for speed over academic credit; validation through translation, not peer review alone

**Protocol Effects:**
- **Coordination:** VC funding + stock options + IP licensing creates coherent funding model
- **Engagement:** IPOs and public markets finance corporate research
- **Preservation:** Patents, regulatory filings, trade secrets as systematic preservation
- **Quality:** FDA regulatory approval + peer review + patent scrutiny
- **Inference:** Startup model enables rapid iteration and risk-taking

---

### Digitized Technical Substrate Era (2000-2024)
**Tagline:** Analog Processes Digitized—But Not Redesigned

**Substrate:** Persistent identifiers (DOIs, ORCIDs, RORs); HTTP/HTTPS and REST APIs; XML metadata schemas (Dublin Core, JATS, DataCite); relational databases with web frontends; PDF as digital paper; email replacing postal mail; web forms replacing paper forms; citation databases (Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar); institutional authentication (Shibboleth, ORCID OAuth); version control (Git); cloud infrastructure emerging

**Overview:** Analog processes are digitized but not redesigned. PDFs replace paper journals, email replaces postal mail, web forms replace paper forms—but the underlying workflows remain unchanged. Digital facsimiles of physical artifacts, not digital-native infrastructure.

**Status:** The three systems' technical infrastructure are beginning to diverge. Without intentional design of a shared technical substrate, fragmentation risks acceleration.

---

### Benefactor Science System (2017)
**Tagline:** A Third Configuration Emerges

**Overview:** A third complete system emerges, distinguished by mandatory openness requirements. Mega-foundations (Gates, Chan Zuckerberg, Wellcome) reconfigure the protocols—requiring preprints before review, mandating data sharing, demanding open source code—creating an alternative to both closed corporate and slow institutional models. Optimized for mission-driven science with radical transparency.

**Configuration:**
- **Dominant:** Engagement + Preservation (radical openness, public access)
- **Values:** Mission impact, accessibility, transparency, equity
- **Timeline:** Varies by mission (some long-term, some rapid)
- **Access:** Fully open (mandated preprints, no APCs, open data)
- **Metrics:** Mission impact, public reach, open compliance, community benefit

**Technical Substrate:** Preprint servers (bioRxiv, medRxiv, arXiv); open repositories (Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad); open source code platforms (GitHub, GitLab); FAIR data principles and open data mandates; CC-BY licensing requirements; open access publishing with no APCs; ORCID integration; open grant databases and transparency requirements

**Policies:**
- **Gates:** "We will not pay any APCs. APCs are not equitable."
- **Astera:** "Complete prohibition on journal publications. We've opted out."

**Rebellion:** Intentionally moving away from the journal system; forcing alternative infrastructure adoption

**Protocol Effects:**
- **Engagement:** Mandatory public preprints before peer review
- **Preservation:** Required data sharing and open source mandates
- **Quality:** Transparent peer review with public preprints
- **Coordination:** Foundation grants with systematic open science requirements

### Polyscientric Research System (2035+)
**Tagline:** Unlimited Configurations Emerge on Shared Technical Substrate

**Overview:** Unlimited new configurations of the scientific protocols emerge and are built with intentionality. Speed-optimized systems validate findings within hours. Tournament systems drive competitive replication. Citizen swarm systems coordinate millions of micro-contributors. AI-hybrid systems integrate human and machine reasoning. Commons systems make all outputs public goods from inception. Monastic systems pursue decade-scale deep investigation.

**Emergence:** These are illustrative examples. The actual diversity will be far greater as communities design systems that embody and serve their specific needs and values.

**Antifragility:** As one system stutters or fails, others thrive. No single point of failure. Science becomes antifragile through plurality.

### Scene 22: The Digitalization Decade Era Card

**The Digitalization Decade (2025-2035)**
**Tagline:** Building Digital-Native Infrastructure

**Overview:** The next decade is about building the shared technical substrate—the shared machine layer enabling multiple scientific systems to interoperate. The work ahead is vast: building the identifiers, schemas, provenance graphs, verification protocols, and execution standards that make interoperability possible. Some groups are already building pieces of this infrastructure across different contexts. Coordination of these efforts toward a unified vision is essential to completing the substrate. Once built, the substrate enables diverse systems to verify each other's claims, share provenance, and build on collective knowledge—even as each system configures the five protocols differently through distinct governance, incentives, and quality thresholds. This plurality creates antifragility: when one system stutters or fails, others carry the weight. As pressure increases on the whole, variety emerges to meet it. Science becomes resilient through many systems, not one.

**The Work Ahead:**

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Identifiers** | Globally unique, resolvable PIDs for all artefacts, including data, code, models, claims, reviews, methods |
| **Schemas & Types** | Canonical object models; content-addressed payloads; semantic registries |
| **Provenance Graph** | Append-only lineage with versioning and cryptographic linking |
| **Verification Protocols** | Test-harness specs, attestation formats, result capsules |
| **Execution & Packaging** | Container/image specs; reproducible environments; build manifests |
| **APIs & Eventing** | Query/submit/subscribe interfaces; audit logs; change feeds |
| **Access & Integrity** | Authn/authz, key management, signatures, timestamping |
| **Registries/Resolvers** | Discovery indices, CID resolvers, capability catalogs |

## NARRATIVE SUMMARY

This narrative tells the 1,200-year story of how scientific systems evolved around five core protocols:

1. **Proto-Science (800-1590):** Isolated knowledge production, hand-copying, patronage-based funding
2. **Pre-Science (1590-1665):** Instruments extend human senses, empirical methodology emerges
3. **Organized Science (1665-1876):** First journals, societies, universities—all five protocols first configured together
4. **Professional Science (1876-1950):** Research universities, PhD requirements, formal peer review
5. **Institutional Science (1950-2025):** Federal funding, digital revolution, mounting crisis

The current Institutional Science System achieved immense success but was never intentionally designed. It emerged organically from 17th-century academic societies and 20th-century government funding. Now it faces mounting stress from:
- Reproducibility crisis
- Fraud epidemic
- Journal monopolies
- Predatory publishers
- Paper mills
- PhD job market collapse
- Funding scarcity
- Data loss

The narrative proposes that the solution is not reformation of the existing system, but **plurality**—thousands of scientific systems, each configuring the five protocols according to their values and constraints, all connected via a shared technical substrate.

Three systems already exist:
1. **Institutional** (1950+): Quality + Coordination dominant, slow, academic credit
2. **Corporate** (1980+): Inference + Coordination dominant, fast, commercial
3. **Benefactor** (2017+): Engagement + Preservation dominant, open, mission-driven

The next decade (2025-2035) is the **Digitalization Decade**: building the shared technical infrastructure that enables interoperability between systems.

The goal: **Polyscientric Research System (2035+)** where unlimited configurations can emerge, creating antifragility through plurality. When one system fails, others thrive. Science becomes resilient through many systems, not one.
